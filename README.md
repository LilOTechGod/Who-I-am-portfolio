# Who I am portfolio
*Having a portfolio is a great way of showcasing your experience and best work along with many other values of yours. *.

## User Story:

**Basically a portfolio is a living and changing collection of records that reflect your accomplishments, skills, experiences, achievements and attributes. I believe providing a portfolio along with my resume is necessary because I understand the importance of setting a good first impression. From a manager's side you need to know if the applicant would be a good fit for the position and if she/he is a teamplayer. Grateful for being intoduced into React because it serves as the front end for lots of companies and organization. Meaning it is best practice to know even the basics! I followd a tutorial to guide me with building a portfolio using react using HTML, CSS JavaScript here and there. This challenge was much harder than it seemed but, has definitely increased my knowledge and got hands on experience using React. **

## Credits

I want to give a shoutout to Leah, my instructor for help making more sense of how models, views, and controllers (MVC) operates and it's importance on how it all connects making the app function properly.
Also thanks to my tutor Mr. Clements Team work makes the dream work!
